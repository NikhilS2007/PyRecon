To create a PyReconstruct development environment run:

make env

By default, a new conda environment called '$ENV_NAME' will be created.
You can change the default environment name by editing '<<<ENV>>>' in the makefile.

Other possible commands:

make help    : Show the current message
make update  : Update packages and shell scripts
make clean   : Remove the PyReconstruct dev environment completely
remove       : Alias for 'make clean'
