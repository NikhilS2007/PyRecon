To create a PyReconstruct development environment run:

make env

By default, a new conda environment called '<<<ENV>>>' will be created.
You can change the default environment name by editing ENV_NAME in the makefile.

Other possible commands:

make help    : Show this help message
make update  : Update packages and shell scripts
make clean   : Remove the PyReconstruct dev environment completely
remove       : Alias for 'make clean'
